    <h1>American Idiot - Green Day</h1>
        <p>
        Don't wanna be an American idiot
        Don't want a nation under the new media
        And can you hear the sound of hysteria?
        The subliminal mind-fuck America
        </p>
        <p>
        Welcome to a new kind of tension
        All across the alien nation
        Where everything isn't meant to be okay
        In television dreams of tomorrow
        We're not the ones who're meant to follow
        For that's enough to argue
        </p>
        <p>
        Well, maybe I'm the faggot, America
        I'm not a part of a redneck agenda
        Now everybody, do the propaganda
        And sing along to the age of paranoia
        </p>
        <p>
        Welcome to a new kind of tension
        All across the alien nation
        Where everything isn't meant to be okay
        In television dreams of tomorrow
        We're not the ones who're meant to follow
        For that's enough to argue
        </p>
        <p>
        Don't wanna be an American idiot
        One nation controlled by the media
        Information age of hysteria
        It's calling out to idiot America
        Welcome to a new kind of tension
        All across the alien nation
        Where everything isn't meant to be okay
        In television dreams of tomorrow
        We're not the ones who're meant to follow
        For that's enough to argue
